  "text": "I only see one keyframe. If there are more, please share them so I can describe each step. Based on this single frame:\n\nFrame 1 (t0):\n- State: Robot is at a centered “home” pose with the gripper open, above the workspace. Objects visible: red cube (front-left), blue cube (mid-left), yellow tennis ball (center), plastic drawer unit on the right. Table is clear otherwise.\n- Action: No manipulation yet; likely perception/initialization and target selection.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The strategy hasn’t been violated yet—no grasp attempts, no collisions, and objects remain undisturbed. No failure mode evident from this frame alone.\n\nWhat to do next (high level):\n- Confirm the target and goal location.\n- If the target is a cube: plan a top‑down approach to a pre‑grasp pose, align gripper with a cube face, close gripper, lift, move to the drop location, place, and verify.\n- If the target is the ball: a parallel gripper may struggle with a free sphere; use containment. Push the ball against the drawer side or into a corner to constrain it, then perform a pinch/cage grasp; lift, move, place, and verify.\n- Throughout: maintain clearance from the drawer unit, avoid sweeping into the other objects, and replan if occlusions or slippage occur."
