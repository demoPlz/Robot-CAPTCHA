A multi-drawer plastic cabinet is on the right; the top drawer has a red label/handle area. The robot end-effector is in the lower-left, far from the cabinet, oriented roughly horizontal. No contact with the drawer yet; ample clearance.\n- Action: Move-to-observation/home or initial approach; no grasp/pull attempted.\n\nStrategy assessment\n- The planned strategy (approach → align → grasp → pull) has not yet been violated; the task is simply still in the pre-grasp stage. No clear failure mode has arisen from this frame alone.\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n- Perception: Localize the target drawer handle/edge; estimate its pose and opening axis.\n- Pre-grasp: Move to a pose ~5–10 cm in front of the handle, align the gripper parallel to the drawer face and at handle height.\n- Grasp: Close on the handle or underside lip; add a small inward seating push.\n- Pull: Apply a controlled pull along the drawer’s opening axis, monitoring force/slip; pause if unexpected resistance.\n- Recovery: If grasp fails or slips, re-localize, adjust orientation/height, and retry; consider a hook/side pinch if the handle is flush."
