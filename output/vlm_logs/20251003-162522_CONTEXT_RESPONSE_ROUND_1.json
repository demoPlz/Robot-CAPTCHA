Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip the drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. From home and with the drawer open, we want to secure another grasp on the blue cube area to ensure it is properly placed; the arm begins to move left, thus: move horizontally to the general area above the blue cube.\n\n16. The gripper is roughly above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the cube.\n\n17. The gripper is pitched and near the cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with the cube’s grasp angle.\n\n18. Alignment complete, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n19. The jaws are set at the grasp point, thus: close the gripper to grasp the blue cube.\n\n20. The cube is grasped, thus: raise the gripper to clear the drawer lip.\n\n21. The cube is clear of obstacles, thus: translate to be over the opened middle drawer.\n\n22. We are over the drawer, thus: open the gripper to release the blue cube into the drawer.\n\n23. With the blue cube in the drawer, we shift focus to the other objects; we need a better vantage, thus: return to the home position.\n\n24. The next target to handle is the red cube, which is too close to the drawer to be safely lifted straight up; first get visual and reachability, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.\n\n25. Above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3cm above the red cube.\n\n26. The gripper is pitched, thus: rotate-only to align with the intended grasp on the red cube.\n\n27. Alignment set, but a straight lift may collide with the drawer; proceed carefully, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n28. Contact at the grasp point is achieved, thus: close the gripper to grasp the red cube.\n\n29. With the red cube held, dragging left risks touching the tennis ball; recover by creating a clear path, thus: translate slightly forward to avoid the ball.\n\n30. A clear path exists, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk with the red cube.\n\n31. The cube is now on the left side with space around it, thus: open the gripper to release the red cube on the left.\n\n32. Repositioning complete; we will now handle the tennis ball, thus: return to the home position.\n\n33. Prepare to move the tennis ball left so it can later be placed into the drawer safely, thus: move to the general area above the tennis ball.\n\n34. Above the ball, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3cm above the ball.\n\n35. The gripper is pitched and centered, thus: rotate-only as needed to align for a secure squeeze on the ball.\n\n36. At the grasp point, thus: close the gripper to grasp the tennis ball.\n\n37. With the ball in hand and a leftward path clear, thus: drag/translate the ball left away from the drawer face.\n\n38. The ball is safely on the left side, thus: open the gripper to release the ball on the left.\n\n39. Both remaining objects are now on the left and safe to place into the open drawer; first improve vantage, thus: return to the home position.\n\n40. We start placing into the drawer with the red cube, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.\n\n41. Over the red cube, thus: lower and pitch to ~3cm above, rotate to align, then lower to the grasp point.\n\n42. The grasp is prepared; continue the pick-and-place into the drawer, thus: close the gripper to grasp, raise to clear the drawer edge, translate above the open drawer, and open the gripper to release the object into the drawer."
