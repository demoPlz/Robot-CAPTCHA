This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object, the blue cube, is completely left of the arm’s base (safe to pick directly into the drawer), we can open the drawer and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer’s handle, thus: close the gripper to grip the drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open (translate-only to the left).\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: translate so the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical ~3 cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n9. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper and object are raised to clear the drawer edge, thus: translate so the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining objects left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is at home while the drawer is open. We must get above the open drawer to push, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to the drawer level without collision.\n\n16. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is positioned above the open drawer, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer front, preparing to push.\n\n17. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is aligned at drawer level, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only inward).\n\n18. We have closed the drawer. The remaining objects are not safely pickable directly into the drawer (too near the drawer area/right of the base). We begin the Move object left protocol for the first remaining object, thus: move the gripper to the general area above the first object, ensuring a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n19. Move object left protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n20. Move object left protocol: The gripper is ~3 cm above and vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the grasp angle.\n\n21. Move object left protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n22. Move object left protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n23. Move object left protocol: We evaluate the drag path. Dragging leftward would collide with another object, thus: translate slightly forward to create a collision-free leftward drag corridor.\n\n24. Move object left protocol: A leftward drag corridor is clear, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk with the grasped object.\n\n25. Move object left protocol: The object is now entirely on the left of the robot, clear of the drawer area, thus: open the gripper to release.\n\n26. We proceed to the second remaining object. A direct straight-line move to ~3 cm above the object would collide with a nearby obstacle, thus: raise the gripper for clearance and translate to a collision-free waypoint, then into the general area above the object.\n\n27. Move object left protocol: The gripper is now in the general area above the object with a collision-free path, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n28. Move object left protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n29. Move object left protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n30. Move object left protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n31. Failure and recovery (intentional): The initial grasp is insufficient and the object slips. To recover while following protocol spirit, thus: open the gripper.\n\n32. Recovery: Reposition ~2 cm closer to the object’s center of mass and slightly adjust yaw, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for a firmer grasp.\n\n33. Recovery: The gripper is lowered and aligned for the second attempt, thus: close gripper to grasp (successful).\n\n34. Move object left protocol: Collision check is clear for left dragging, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n35. Move object left protocol: The object is now entirely on the left of the robot, clear of the drawer area, thus: open the gripper to release.\n\n36. With both remaining objects now left of the base, we can open the drawer again, starting the Open drawer protocol, thus: raise the gripper such that it is higher than the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n37. Open drawer protocol: The gripper is higher than the handle, thus: position the gripper to grasp the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n38. Open drawer protocol: The gripper is in position on the handle, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n39. Open drawer protocol: The handle is grasped, thus: move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n40. Open drawer protocol: The drawer is open, thus: release the gripper.\n\n41. Open drawer protocol: To begin pick-and-place into the open drawer, thus: return to the home position.\n\n42. Pick and place item into drawer protocol (first remaining object): From home, move to the general area above the object with a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n43. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n44. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n45. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n46. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n47. Pick and place protocol: The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n48. Pick and place protocol: Clearance achieved, thus: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n49. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n50. Pick and place item into drawer protocol (second remaining object): Move to the general area above the object with a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n51. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is in the general area, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n52. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n53. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n54. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n55. Pick and place protocol: The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n56. Pick and place protocol: Clearance achieved, thus: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n57. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n58. Close drawer protocol (finalizing): With all objects placed, we must close the drawer, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to drawer level without collision.\n\n59. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is positioned above the drawer, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer front, preparing to push.\n\n60. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is aligned at drawer level, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only inward).\n\n61. Task completion: The drawer is closed and the desk is cleared, thus: return to the home position."
