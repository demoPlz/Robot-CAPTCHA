  "text": "I only see one keyframe. Here’s the state–action description for this frame, followed by analysis and next steps.\n\nFrame 1\n- State: On the tabletop, a red cube is near the center‑front, a blue cube is to the left-front, and a yellow ball is farther upfield. The camera view is heavily occluded by a forearm/hand over the red cube. The tool/end‑effector tip is low and near the front edge of the red cube.\n- Action: The hand/end‑effector appears to be contacting or beginning a side grasp on the red cube, likely pushing it slightly while reaching around it. The approach is lateral and occludes the camera.\n\nAnalysis\n- The current move does not follow a robust strategy for reliable grasping: the approach both occludes perception and risks pushing the red cube or colliding with the nearby blue cube. This is a failure mode: side-approach with camera occlusion and poor clearance.\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n- Abort and back off to a clear pre‑grasp pose above the red cube (top‑down), restoring full visibility.\n- Reorient gripper so jaws are parallel to the cube faces; ensure at least a few centimeters of clearance from the blue cube.\n- Execute a two‑stage motion: descend vertically, close gripper with moderate force, then lift vertically to avoid sweeping the cube.\n- Transport to the goal while maintaining clearance from the blue cube and yellow ball; if slip is detected, increase grip slightly."
