I’ll describe it and assess progress so far; if there are more frames, please share them for a complete timeline.\n\nFrame 1\n- State: Workspace is clear; the white plastic drawer unit is on the right. The robot/end-effector is not in contact with the drawer; gripper appears open and positioned far from the handle.\n- Action: Observation/setup pose; no grasp or pull has been attempted yet.\n\nStrategy vs. failure\n- The strategy (perceive target, move to pre‑grasp, grasp handle, pull) has not progressed beyond the observation/pre‑grasp stage. No failure mode is evident yet; the task simply hasn’t started interacting with the drawer.\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n- Perceive and localize the target drawer handle (estimate pose and approach vector).\n- Plan a collision‑free approach from the front-right, align gripper normal to the drawer face, pre‑shape to the handle width.\n- Move to a guarded pre‑contact pose, close on the handle lip, then pull along the drawer’s opening axis while monitoring force/slip.\n- If contact is missed or the gripper slips, retract, re-localize, and re-approach with adjusted pose or gripper width."
