  "task": "drawer",
  "text": "1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. We are at the home position with the drawer open; before moving objects left we should close the drawer, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the open drawer without collision.\n\n16. We are above the open drawer; to prepare to push it closed, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer.\n\n17. The gripper is level with the drawer; to close it, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n18. The drawer is closed; to begin moving remaining objects left, thus: return to the home position.\n\n19. We need to move the nearest remaining object left; to get it into wrist camera view and avoid collision, thus: move the gripper to the general area ~3cm above the object via a straight-line, collision-free path.\n\n20. The gripper is in the general area above the object; to prepare for grasp, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object’s grasp point.\n\n21. The gripper is lowered and pitched; to align for grasp, thus: rotate-only the gripper to the object’s grasp angle.\n\n22. The gripper is aligned; to make contact, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n23. The gripper is positioned; to acquire the object, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n24. We have grasped; dragging leftward would collide with another object; to clear the path, thus: translate forward slightly to create a collision-free leftward corridor.\n\n25. The leftward path is clear; to reposition left, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n26. The object is now entirely on the left of the arm base; to release, thus: open the gripper.\n\n27. We need to move the second remaining object left; the current straight-line path above it would collide, thus: reposition the gripper to a safe approach pose ~3cm above the object via a collision-free straight segment.\n\n28. The gripper is in the general area above the object; to prepare for grasp, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the grasp point.\n\n29. The gripper is lowered and pitched; to align for grasp, thus: rotate-only the gripper to the grasp angle.\n\n30. The gripper is aligned; to make contact, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n31. A minor slip occurred during closing (object shifted); to recover, thus: open the gripper, raise ~2cm, and micro-adjust to center over the object.\n\n32. The gripper is re-centered; to prepare again, thus: lower and pitch to ~3cm above the new grasp point.\n\n33. The gripper is positioned; to refine alignment, thus: rotate-only to the corrected grasp angle.\n\n34. The gripper is aligned; to make contact, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n35. The gripper is positioned; to acquire the object, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n36. The leftward path is clear; to reposition left, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n37. The object is now entirely on the left of the arm base; to release, thus: open the gripper.\n\n38. Both remaining objects are now safely left of the arm base; we can open the drawer to place them, thus: raise the gripper to be higher than the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n39. The gripper is higher than the handle; to grasp the handle, thus: position the gripper to the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n40. We are in position to grasp; thus: close the gripper to grip the handle.\n\n41. We have grasped the handle; to open the drawer, thus: move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n42. The drawer is open; to free the gripper, thus: release the gripper.\n\n43. We will start placing the first left-positioned object; to reset, thus: return to the home position.\n\n44. We need to get above the first object; to ensure camera view and collision-free approach, thus: move horizontally so the gripper is ~3cm above the object.\n\n45. The gripper is in the general area above the object; to prepare for grasp, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n46. The gripper is lowered and pitched; to align, thus: rotate-only the gripper to the object’s grasp angle.\n\n47. The gripper is aligned; to make contact, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n48. The gripper is positioned; to acquire the object, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n49. The object is grasped; to avoid hitting the drawer edge, thus: raise (translation-only) the gripper until the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n50. Clearance achieved; to position for release, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.\n\n51. The gripper is above the opened drawer; to release, thus: open the gripper to drop the object into the drawer.\n\n52. We will place the final object; to reset, thus: return to the home position.\n\n53. We need to get above the final object; to ensure camera view and collision-free approach, thus: translate the gripper to ~3cm above the object via a straight-line path.\n\n54. The gripper is in the general area above the object; to prepare for grasp, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n55. The gripper is lowered and pitched; to align, thus: rotate-only the gripper to the object’s grasp angle.\n\n56. The gripper is aligned; to make contact, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n57. The gripper is positioned; to acquire the object, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n58. The object is grasped; to avoid hitting the drawer edge, thus: raise (translation-only) the gripper until the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n59. Clearance achieved; to position for release, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.\n\n60. The gripper is above the opened drawer; to release, thus: open the gripper to drop the object into the drawer.\n\n61. All objects are now inside; to finish, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the open drawer without collision.\n\n62. The gripper is above the drawer; to prepare to push, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer.\n\n63. The gripper is level with the drawer; to complete, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n64. The drawer is closed and all objects are inside; thus: return to the home position. Task complete."
