  "text": "I only have one keyframe. I’ll describe this frame and infer progress; if there are more frames, please share them and I’ll extend the step-by-step log.\n\nFrame 1\n- State: Plastic drawer unit is on the right side; all drawers appear closed. The robot/tool is far from the drawers (a cylindrical tool tip is visible at the lower-left edge), with no contact. The gripper/end-effector in the back is open. No target object is visible on the work surface.\n- Action taken: Observation/idle. No approach-to-drawer or grasp attempt is evident.\n- Resulting state: System remains in the initial/pre-grasp configuration; target (drawer handle/lip) is visible but unengaged.\n\nStrategy assessment\n- The nominal strategy for a drawer task would be: detect drawer handle/lip → move to a pre-grasp pose aligned with the handle → close gripper on the handle/edge → pull to open with compliant control.\n- Based on the single frame, the policy has not yet transitioned from perception to the “approach and grasp” phase. This looks like a stall rather than an executed failure (no wrong grasp or collision observed). Possible gating failure: perception-to-motion trigger, mislocalized drawer pose, or conservative distance threshold preventing the approach.\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n- Re-localize the drawer: detect the front face plane and handle/lip; estimate pose in robot coordinates. Sanity-check the transform by projecting the intended pre-grasp pose into the image.\n- Command an approach:\n  - Move to a pre-grasp pose 2–3 cm in front of the chosen drawer handle/lip, gripper opening wider than handle thickness, gripper normal perpendicular to the drawer face.\n  - Approach along the drawer normal with low speed, stop on contact or at planned offset.\n  - Close gripper to secure the handle/edge; switch to impedance control and pull straight back 5–10 cm.\n- If approach is still not initiated, debug triggers: verify camera-to-base calibration, perception confidence thresholds, collision model of the drawer unit, and safety stop conditions."
