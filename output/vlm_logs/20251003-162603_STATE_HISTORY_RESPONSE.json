Workspace contains a red cube (front-left), a blue cube (mid-left), and a yellow tennis ball (mid-right). A plastic drawer unit is an obstacle on the right. No object is grasped; all items are stationary.\n- Action: Perception/scene setup. The system has positioned to view the workspace; no manipulation yet.\n\nStrategy check\n- The strategy appears to be followed so far (initial perception and setup). No failure mode evident yet.\n\nHigh-level next steps\n- Confirm target object and goal (e.g., which item to pick and where to place).\n- Plan a collision-free approach that keeps clearance from the drawer unit on the right.\n- If targeting the ball: approach from above, align gripper jaws centered on the ball, set appropriate jaw width, slow final approach, close, lift.\n- If targeting a cube: approach top-down, align jaws with opposing faces, close, lift.\n- After grasp, transport along a safe path, place at the goal, and verify placement."
