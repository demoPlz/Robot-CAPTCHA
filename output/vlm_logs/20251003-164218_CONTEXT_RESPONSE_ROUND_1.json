Since at least one object—the blue cube—is completely left of the arm’s base, we can open the drawer and put the blue cube into it. Next: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer’s handle. Next: close the gripper to grip the drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped the handle. Next: pull the drawer open (translate-only, left).\n\n4. The drawer is open. Next: release the gripper from the handle.\n\n5. We will start putting objects into the drawer; the blue cube is the only object sufficiently far from the drawer to grasp safely. Next: return to the home position.\n\n6. Move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare for grasp. Next: translate such that the gripper is over the cube.\n\n7. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube. Next: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3 cm above the cube.\n\n8. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is lowered and pitched ~3 cm above the cube. Next: rotate the gripper to align with the grasp angle.\n\n9. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is aligned with the grasp angle. Next: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp. Next: close the gripper to grasp the cube.\n\n11. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is closed and holding the cube. Next: raise the gripper so the object clears the drawer’s edge height.\n\n12. Pick-and-place protocol: the object is raised to clear the drawer edge. Next: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n13. Pick-and-place protocol: the gripper is above the opened drawer. Next: open the gripper to release the cube into the drawer.\n\n14. We will handle the remaining objects (which may require repositioning left). Next: return to the home position.\n\n15. From home, start moving toward the right side to plan a collision-free path around the open drawer. Next: translate to begin the approach for the next grasp.\n\n16. Minor adjustment near the drawer to ensure free motion. Next: reposition safely for the next approach.\n\n17. Back at home to reset approach. Next: move toward the cubes’ area.\n\n18. Move to the general area above the front-left objects, centering on the blue cube. Next: translate to be directly above the cube.\n\n19. The gripper is above the blue cube. Next: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above it.\n\n20. Lowered and pitched ~3 cm above the cube. Next: rotate to align with the grasp angle.\n\n21. Rotation-only alignment completed. Next: lower further to prepare to grasp.\n\n22. Gripper lowered to the grasp height. Next: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n23. Gripper closed; cube grasped. Next: raise to clear the drawer edge.\n\n24. Object lifted to a safe height. Next: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n25. Over the drawer. Next: open gripper to release the cube.\n\n26. Cube released into the drawer. Next: return to home.\n\n27. Back at home with the drawer open and at least one item inside. Next: plan to handle the remaining objects.\n\n28. Begin moving toward the right to evaluate approach paths around the open drawer. Next: continue positioning.\n\n29. Continue coarse positioning with the wrist camera keeping the scene in view. Next: prepare to approach the tennis ball.\n\n30. Re-center at home for a straight-line path. Next: move to the general area above the tennis ball.\n\n31. The gripper is in the general area above the tennis ball. Next: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above the ball.\n\n32. Lowered and pitched above the ball. Next: rotate to align with the grasp.\n\n33. Rotation-only alignment done. Next: lower to grasp height.\n\n34. Lowered to grasp height. Next: close gripper to grasp the ball.\n\n35. Gripper closed on the ball. Next: raise to clear the drawer edge.\n\n36. Ball lifted. Next: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n37. Over the drawer. Next: open gripper to release the ball.\n\n38. Gripper opens; ball starts to release. If the ball rolls or does not settle, we will recover. Next: allow the ball to settle and reassess.\n\n39. The ball does not appear fully settled inside the drawer. Next: return to home to plan a recovery pick.\n\n40. Back at home; the ball is still on or near the drawer/desk. Next: begin repositioning of the red cube away from the drawer (move object left protocol) to make later grasps safer.\n\n41. Move to the general area near the red cube. Next: adjust approach for a straight-line path.\n\n42. Quick reset at home to avoid a potential collision path. Next: move directly above the red cube.\n\n43. Over the red cube. Next: pitch vertical for a firm drag/grasp.\n\n44. Rotation-only to align with cube faces. Next: lower toward the cube.\n\n45. Lowered to contact height. Next: close the gripper.\n\n46. Gripper closed; contact established. Next: drag left along the desk (translate-only) to reposition the cube entirely left of the arm base.\n\n47. Dragging left begins. Next: continue leftward translation.\n\n48. Continue dragging left to clear the drawer area.\n\n49. Cube is now entirely left of the arm base, away from the drawer zone. Next: open gripper to release the cube.\n\n50. Cube released at the left. Next: return to home.\n\n51. Back at home. Next: prepare to pick and place the repositioned red cube into the drawer.\n\n52. Confirmation at home for a safe straight-line approach. Next: move to the general area above the red cube.\n\n53. Translate to be above the red cube. Next: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above it.\n\n54. Lowered and pitched above the cube. Next: rotate to align with grasp angle.\n\n55. Rotation-only alignment complete. Next: lower to grasp height.\n\n56. Lowered to grasp height. Next: close the gripper.\n\n57. Approach appears constrained by drawer geometry; choose a new approach. Next: return to home to replan.\n\n58. Move to the right to maintain clearance with the open drawer while keeping objects in view. Next: reassess the ball state.\n\n59. Visual check: items are inside the drawer and on the desk; the ball needs a reliable place. Next: return to home and plan a robust pick of the ball.\n\n60. Back at home. Next: verify ball location and approach it.\n\n61. Observation: the ball has rolled to the upper-left of the desk. Next: move to the general area above the ball.\n\n62. Translate to be above the ball. Next: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above it.\n\n63. Minor alignment for a collision-free straight-line approach. Next: finalize approach from a safer rightward path.\n\n64. Reset at home to take the right-side approach. Next: move in from the right toward the ball.\n\n65. Translate from the right to be above the ball. Next: lower and pitch to ~3 cm above it.\n\n66. Lowered and pitched above the ball. Next: rotate to align for a stable grasp.\n\n67. Rotation-only alignment complete. Next: lower to grasp height.\n\n68. Lowered to grasp height. Next: close gripper to grasp the ball.\n\n69. Ball grasped. Next: raise to clear the drawer edge.\n\n70. Lifted and translated over the opened drawer. Next: position squarely above the drawer.\n\n71. Over the drawer. Next: open gripper to release the ball.\n\n72. Ball released into the drawer; verify it settles fully inside. Next: return to home.\n\n73. Back at home with the drawer open and multiple items inside. The next steps (not shown) are to pick and place the red cube into the drawer if it remains on the desk, then close the drawer following the close drawer protocol."
