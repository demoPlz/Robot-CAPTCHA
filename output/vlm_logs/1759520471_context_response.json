  "prompt": "Consider a system where states from a robot manipulation task are shown to remote users, who in turn provide action labels for corresponding states. Those action labels are in the form of the next-best-pose or gripper open/close, which the robot will move linearly to attain, i.e. move in a straight line and/or rotate in a linear fashion to achieve the pose specified by the label.\n\nThe high level task here is {task}. The optimal strategy for executing this task is the following:\n\nHigh level:\n\nIf any items can be picked directly into the drawer without repositioning (entirely on the left of the arm base, to leave ample space; otherwise they risk being in an inconvenient location near or under the drawer when opened opens), open the middle drawer. Pick and place each valid items into the drawer. Close the drawer. If there are still objects left (those not directly pickable without repositioning), move them to be entirely on the left of the robot one to one. Then open the middle drawer, pick and place each, and close the drawer.\n\n\nLower level:\n\nMove object left protocol:\n\n1. If the gripper is not in the general area above the object, or it cannot travel to be ~3cm above the object in a straight line without collision, move the gripper to satisfy these conditions. Else, go to step 2. This is to ensure that the object is in the wrist camera view of the arm, and we can execute step 2 without collision.\n\n2. Lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object, or its grasp point.\n\n3. Rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n4. Lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n5. Close gripper to grasp.\n\n6. If dragging leftward will colide with another object, move forward or backward, such that the gripper and the object can move leftward without collision.\n\n7. Drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n8. Open the gripper.\n\nOpen drawer protocol:\n\n1. If the gripper is not higher than the middle drawer's handle, raise the gripper such that it is. Else, move to step 2. This is to ensure that when we execute step 2 we get the correct grasp (one finger on top of the handle, one finger underneath the handle).\n\n2. Position the gripper to grasp to the middle drawer's handle.\n\n3. Close the gripper to grasp.\n\n4. Move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n5. Release the gripper.\n\n6. Return to the home position.\n\n\n\nPick and place item into drawer protocol:\n\n1. If the gripper is not in the general area above the object, or it cannot travel to be ~3cm above the object in a straight line without collision, move the gripper to satisfy these conditions. Else, go to step 2. This is to ensure that the object is in the wrist camera view of the arm, and we can execute step 2 without collision.\n\n2. Lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object, or its grasp point.\n\n3. Rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n4. Lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n5. Close gripper to grasp.\n\n6. Raise (translation-only) the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n7. Move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.\n\n8. Open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n\nClose drawer protocol:\n\n1. Move such that the gripper is a) above the open drawer and b) can move down to be on the same level as the open drawer without collision.\n\n2. Move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer, to prepare to push the drawer close.\n\n3. Push the the drawer close.\n\nCommon failure modes that may lead to deviations from the strategies and how to recover from each are as follows:\n\nNo failure modes recorded yet. Follow the spirit of our strategy to react to failures modes (states not described in strategy).\n\nThis sequence of keyframes shows an example full execution of the task, with intentional demonstrations of failure cases and recoveries. The first frame shows the arm in the home position, which may occur in subsequent frames as well. For each key frame, describe what has happened, and what next step is taken to achieve the next frame. Example descriptions in \"state-action description format\" for the first frames are as follows. Follow the format, inluding the practice of numbering, to describe all frames (including frames described in the example).\n\n1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8: We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\nYour output will be referred to as the \"description bank.\"",

Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: translate so the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical ~3 cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n9. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper and object are raised to clear the drawer edge, thus: translate so the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. Pick and place item into drawer protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining objects left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is at home while the drawer is open. We must get above the open drawer to push, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to the drawer level without collision.\n\n16. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is positioned above the open drawer, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer front, preparing to push.\n\n17. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is aligned at drawer level, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only inward).\n\n18. We have closed the drawer. The remaining objects are not safely pickable directly into the drawer (too near the drawer area/right of the base). We begin the Move object left protocol for the first remaining object, thus: move the gripper to the general area above the first object, ensuring a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n19. Move object left protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n20. Move object left protocol: The gripper is ~3 cm above and vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the grasp angle.\n\n21. Move object left protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n22. Move object left protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n23. Move object left protocol: We evaluate the drag path. Dragging leftward would collide with another object, thus: translate slightly forward to create a collision-free leftward drag corridor.\n\n24. Move object left protocol: A leftward drag corridor is clear, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk with the grasped object.\n\n25. Move object left protocol: The object is now entirely on the left of the robot, clear of the drawer area, thus: open the gripper to release.\n\n26. We proceed to the second remaining object. A direct straight-line move to ~3 cm above the object would collide with a nearby obstacle, thus: raise the gripper for clearance and translate to a collision-free waypoint, then into the general area above the object.\n\n27. Move object left protocol: The gripper is now in the general area above the object with a collision-free path, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n28. Move object left protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n29. Move object left protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n30. Move object left protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n31. Failure and recovery (intentional): The initial grasp is insufficient and the object slips. To recover while following protocol spirit, thus: open the gripper.\n\n32. Recovery: Reposition ~2 cm closer to the object’s center of mass and slightly adjust yaw, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for a firmer grasp.\n\n33. Recovery: The gripper is lowered and aligned for the second attempt, thus: close gripper to grasp (successful).\n\n34. Move object left protocol: Collision check is clear for left dragging, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n35. Move object left protocol: The object is now entirely on the left of the robot, clear of the drawer area, thus: open the gripper to release.\n\n36. With both remaining objects now left of the base, we can open the drawer again, starting the Open drawer protocol, thus: raise the gripper such that it is higher than the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n37. Open drawer protocol: The gripper is higher than the handle, thus: position the gripper to grasp the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n38. Open drawer protocol: The gripper is in position on the handle, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n39. Open drawer protocol: The handle is grasped, thus: move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n40. Open drawer protocol: The drawer is open, thus: release the gripper.\n\n41. Open drawer protocol: To begin pick-and-place into the open drawer, thus: return to the home position.\n\n42. Pick and place item into drawer protocol (first remaining object): From home, move to the general area above the object with a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n43. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is in the general area above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n44. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n45. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n46. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n47. Pick and place protocol: The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n48. Pick and place protocol: Clearance achieved, thus: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n49. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n50. Pick and place item into drawer protocol (second remaining object): Move to the general area above the object with a straight-line path to ~3 cm above without collision.\n\n51. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is in the general area, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3 cm above the object.\n\n52. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is vertical ~3 cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to align with the grasp angle.\n\n53. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n54. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n55. Pick and place protocol: The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the object clears the drawer edge height.\n\n56. Pick and place protocol: Clearance achieved, thus: translate to be above the opened drawer.\n\n57. Pick and place protocol: The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n58. Close drawer protocol (finalizing): With all objects placed, we must close the drawer, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to drawer level without collision.\n\n59. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is positioned above the drawer, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer front, preparing to push.\n\n60. Close drawer protocol: The gripper is aligned at drawer level, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only inward).\n\n61.
