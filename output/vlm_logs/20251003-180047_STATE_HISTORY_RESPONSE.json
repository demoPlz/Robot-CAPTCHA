Action: Close gripper to grasp red cube.\n29. State: Red cube grasped. Action: Translate left along desk (drag) to clear drawer area.\n30. State: Cube left of arm base. Action: Open gripper to release.\n31. State: Cube released safely left. Action: Return to home.\n32. State: Recover ball placement. Action: Move above ball on lip.\n33. State: Above ball. Action: Lower and pitch vertical to ~3 cm above.\n34. State: ~3 cm above. Action: Rotate to grasp angle.\n35. State: Aligned. Action: Lower to grasp height.\n36. State: At grasp height. Action: Close gripper to grasp ball.\n37. State: Ball grasped. Action: Raise to clear drawer edge.\n38. State: Raised. Action: Translate over open drawer.\n39. State: Over drawer. Action: Open gripper to release ball fully inside.\n40. State: Ball placed inside. Action: Return to home.\n41. State: Ready to place red cube. Action: Move above red cube (left).\n42. State: Above red cube. Action: Lower and pitch vertical to ~3 cm above.\n43. State: ~3 cm above. Action: Rotate to cube grasp angle.\n44. State: Aligned. Action: Lower to grasp height.\n45. State: At grasp height. Action: Close gripper to grasp red cube.\n46. State: Red cube grasped. Action: Raise to clear drawer edge.\n47. State: Raised. Action: Translate over open drawer.\n48. State: Over drawer. Action: Open gripper to drop red cube inside.\n49. State: All items in drawer. Action: Move above drawer front to prepare push-close.\n50. State: Above drawer front. Action: Lower and rotate flat to contact drawer.\n51. State: In contact. Action: Push drawer closed.\n52. State: Drawer closed; task complete. Action: Return to home.\n\nNew run / continuation\n53. State: Drawer open; blue cube inside; ball on lip; red cube left of center. Gripper above red cube. Action: Lower and pitch vertical to ~3 cm above red cube.\n54. State: ~3 cm above red cube. Action: Rotate to cube grasp angle.\n55. State: Aligned. Action: Lower to grasp height.\n56. State: At grasp height. Action: Close gripper to grasp red cube.\n57. State: Red cube grasped. Action: Raise to clear drawer edge.\n58. State: Raised. Action: Translate over open drawer, avoiding ball on lip.\n59. State: Over drawer. Action: Open gripper to drop red cube inside.\n60. State: Red cube inside; ball still on lip. Action: Return to home.\n61. State: Plan to re-grasp ball. Action: Move toward area above ball on lip.\n62. State: Approach constrained; collision risk with drawer front. Action: Adjust pose to search for safe top-down approach.\n63. State: Approach remains unsafe. Action: Abort and return to home to re-plan.\n\nAnalysis\n\n- Strategy adherence: The plan to open drawer, place items, and close it was largely followed. A recurring failure mode occurred when the ball landed on the drawer lip, creating a constrained approach with collision risk, leading to an abort (frames 61–63).\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n\n- Create clearance before re-grasping the ball:\n  - Option A: Pull the drawer further open to increase vertical clearance, then perform a top-down grasp of the ball and release it inside.\n  - Option B: Use a controlled lateral push from a safe side approach to nudge the ball fully into the drawer, then verify placement.\n- After securing the ball, close the drawer and return to home.\n\nChoose the option that yields the safest, collision-free path given current geometry; opening the drawer further (Option A) is generally preferred for reliable top-down grasp."
