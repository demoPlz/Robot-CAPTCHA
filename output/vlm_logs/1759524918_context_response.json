  "prompt": "Consider a system where states from a robot manipulation task are shown to remote users, who in turn provide action labels for corresponding states. Those action labels are in the form of the next-best-pose or gripper open/close, which the robot will move linearly to attain, i.e. move in a straight line and/or rotate in a linear fashion to achieve the pose specified by the label.\n\nThe high level task here is {task}. The optimal strategy for executing this task is the following:\n\nHigh level:\n\nIf any items can be picked directly into the drawer without repositioning (entirely on the left of the arm base, to leave ample space; otherwise they risk being in an inconvenient location near or under the drawer when opened opens), open the middle drawer. Pick and place each valid items into the drawer. Close the drawer. If there are still objects left (those not directly pickable without repositioning), move them to be entirely on the left of the robot one to one. Then open the middle drawer, pick and place each, and close the drawer.\n\n\nLower level:\n\nMove object left protocol:\n\n1. If the gripper is not in the general area above the object, or it cannot travel to be ~3cm above the object in a straight line without collision, move the gripper to satisfy these conditions. Else, go to step 2. This is to ensure that the object is in the wrist camera view of the arm, and we can execute step 2 without collision.\n\n2. Lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object, or its grasp point.\n\n3. Rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n4. Lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n5. Close gripper to grasp.\n\n6. If dragging leftward will colide with another object, move forward or backward, such that the gripper and the object can move leftward without collision.\n\n7. Drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.\n\n8. Open the gripper.\n\nOpen drawer protocol:\n\n1. If the gripper is not higher than the middle drawer's handle, raise the gripper such that it is. Else, move to step 2. This is to ensure that when we execute step 2 we get the correct grasp (one finger on top of the handle, one finger underneath the handle).\n\n2. Position the gripper to grasp to the middle drawer's handle.\n\n3. Close the gripper to grasp.\n\n4. Move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n5.

Move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer, to prepare to push the drawer close.\n\n3. Push the the drawer close.\n\nCommon failure modes that may lead to deviations from the strategies and how to recover from each are as follows:\n\nNo failure modes recorded yet. Follow the spirit of our strategy to react to failures modes (states not described in strategy).\n\nThis sequence of keyframes shows an example full execution of the task, with intentional demonstrations of failure cases and recoveries. The first frame shows the arm in the home position, which may occur in subsequent frames as well. For each key frame, describe what has happened, and what next step is taken to achieve the next frame. Example descriptions in \"state-action description format\" for the first frames are as follows. Follow the format, inluding the practice of numbering, to describe all frames (including frames described in the example).\n\n1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8: We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9.

We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. The drawer is open and we need to close it before repositioning other items, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open middle drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the drawer without collision.\n\n16. We are above the open drawer and clear to descend, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer to prepare to push the drawer closed.\n\n17. The gripper is aligned with the drawer face, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n18. The drawer is closed; we now need to move remaining objects to be entirely on the left of the robot, thus: return to the home position.\n\n19. We will move the first right-side object left. The gripper must be above the object with a straight-line approach, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the first object.\n\n20. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n21. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n22. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n23. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n24. While planning to drag left, we observe another object close to the path that could cause collision, thus: move backward slightly (translate-only) to create clearance for a leftward drag.\n\n25. Clearance is established, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to reposition the object entirely to the left of the arm base.\n\n26. The object is now left of the base, thus: open the gripper to release the object.\n\n27. We will move the second right-side object left. A straight-line approach to ~3cm above the object from the current pose would collide with the arm base, thus: reposition (translate-only) to a vantage above the object that allows a collision-free straight-line descent while keeping the object in the wrist camera view.\n\n28. We have a valid vantage above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n29. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n30. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n31. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n32. As we begin to drag left, the object starts to slip from the grasp (failure), thus: stop the drag and raise slightly (translate-only) to stabilize.\n\n33. We need a firmer alignment to prevent slip, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to refine the grasp alignment, then lower (translate-only) back to contact.\n\n34. The gripper is re-aligned and at contact, thus: close gripper to regrasp and drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to reposition the object entirely to the left of the arm base.\n\n35. The second object is now left of the base, thus: open the gripper to release the object.\n\n36. Both remaining objects are now safely left of the base; we need the drawer open to place them inside, thus: raise the gripper to be higher than the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n37. The gripper is above the handle height, thus: position the gripper to grasp the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n38. We are in position to grip the handle, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n39. The handle is grasped, thus: move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n40. The drawer is open, thus: release the gripper.\n\n41. The drawer is open and clear; prepare to pick and place the first left-side object, thus: return to the home position.\n\n42. We need to approach the first left-side object for pick-and-place, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the object.\n\n43. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n44. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n45. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n46. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n47. We begin to lift to clear the drawer edge but notice the object is near the edge height (risk of bump), thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper while monitoring clearance.\n\n48. A slight bump is detected on the drawer edge (minor failure), thus: raise further (translate-only) to fully clear the drawer edge.\n\n49. The object now clears the drawer, thus: move (translate-only) horizontally to be above the opened middle drawer.\n\n50. We are above the opened drawer, thus: open the gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n51. One object is placed; prepare to pick and place the second left-side object, thus: return to the home position.\n\n52. We need to approach the second left-side object for pick-and-place, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the object.\n\n53. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n54. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n55. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n56. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n57. The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the gripper and object clear the height of the drawer edge.\n\n58. We clear the edge, thus: move (translate-only) to be above the opened drawer.\n\n59. We are above the opened drawer, thus: open the gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n60. All objects are in the drawer; we need to close it, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the drawer without collision.\n\n61. We are above the drawer and clear to descend, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer to prepare to push the drawer close.\n\n62. The gripper is aligned with the drawer face, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n63. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position.",
