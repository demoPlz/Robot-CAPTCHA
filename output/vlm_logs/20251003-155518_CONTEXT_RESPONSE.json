  "task": "drawer",
  "text": "1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.\n\n2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.\n\n3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.\n\n4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.\n\n5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.\n\n6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.\n\n7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.\n\n8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.\n\n9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.\n\n12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.\n\n13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.\n\n14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.\n\n15. The drawer is open and we need to close it before repositioning other items, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open middle drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the drawer without collision.\n\n16. We are above the open drawer and clear to descend, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer to prepare to push the drawer closed.\n\n17. The gripper is aligned with the drawer face, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n18. The drawer is closed; we now need to move remaining objects to be entirely on the left of the robot, thus: return to the home position.\n\n19. We will move the first right-side object left. The gripper must be above the object with a straight-line approach, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the first object.\n\n20. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n21. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n22. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n23. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n24. While planning to drag left, we observe another object close to the path that could cause collision, thus: move backward slightly (translate-only) to create clearance for a leftward drag.\n\n25. Clearance is established, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to reposition the object entirely to the left of the arm base.\n\n26. The object is now left of the base, thus: open the gripper to release the object.\n\n27. We will move the second right-side object left. A straight-line approach to ~3cm above the object from the current pose would collide with the arm base, thus: reposition (translate-only) to a vantage above the object that allows a collision-free straight-line descent while keeping the object in the wrist camera view.\n\n28. We have a valid vantage above the object, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n29. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n30. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n31. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n32. As we begin to drag left, the object starts to slip from the grasp (failure), thus: stop the drag and raise slightly (translate-only) to stabilize.\n\n33. We need a firmer alignment to prevent slip, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to refine the grasp alignment, then lower (translate-only) back to contact.\n\n34. The gripper is re-aligned and at contact, thus: close gripper to regrasp and drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to reposition the object entirely to the left of the arm base.\n\n35. The second object is now left of the base, thus: open the gripper to release the object.\n\n36. Both remaining objects are now safely left of the base; we need the drawer open to place them inside, thus: raise the gripper to be higher than the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n37. The gripper is above the handle height, thus: position the gripper to grasp the middle drawer’s handle.\n\n38. We are in position to grip the handle, thus: close the gripper to grasp.\n\n39. The handle is grasped, thus: move the gripper to the left (translate-only) to drag the drawer open.\n\n40. The drawer is open, thus: release the gripper.\n\n41. The drawer is open and clear; prepare to pick and place the first left-side object, thus: return to the home position.\n\n42. We need to approach the first left-side object for pick-and-place, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the object.\n\n43. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n44. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n45. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n46. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n47. We begin to lift to clear the drawer edge but notice the object is near the edge height (risk of bump), thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper while monitoring clearance.\n\n48. A slight bump is detected on the drawer edge (minor failure), thus: raise further (translate-only) to fully clear the drawer edge.\n\n49. The object now clears the drawer, thus: move (translate-only) horizontally to be above the opened middle drawer.\n\n50. We are above the opened drawer, thus: open the gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n51. One object is placed; prepare to pick and place the second left-side object, thus: return to the home position.\n\n52. We need to approach the second left-side object for pick-and-place, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area ~3cm above the object.\n\n53. We are above the object and clear to descend, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the object.\n\n54. The gripper is pitched vertical, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the object’s grasp angle.\n\n55. The grasp angle is aligned, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.\n\n56. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp.\n\n57. The object is grasped, thus: raise (translate-only) the gripper such that the gripper and object clear the height of the drawer edge.\n\n58. We clear the edge, thus: move (translate-only) to be above the opened drawer.\n\n59. We are above the opened drawer, thus: open the gripper to release the object into the drawer.\n\n60. All objects are in the drawer; we need to close it, thus: move such that the gripper is above the open drawer and can move down to be on the same level as the drawer without collision.\n\n61. We are above the drawer and clear to descend, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer to prepare to push the drawer close.\n\n62. The gripper is aligned with the drawer face, thus: push the drawer closed.\n\n63. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position."
