  "text": "I only see one keyframe in the sequence you provided. Here is the state–action description for that frame, followed by strategy analysis and next-step guidance.\n\nFrame 1\n- State: Robot arm is at a distant/home pose facing forward; gripper is open and empty. The plastic drawer unit (likely the target) is on the right side of the workspace. No contact with any objects; approach path to the drawers is clear.\n- Action: None yet (idle/initialized at home).\n\nStrategy assessment\n- If the strategy is “approach the drawer → align to a handle → grasp/engage → pull,” it has not begun yet. No failure mode is evident; we’re simply still at the initial pose.\n\nWhat to do next (high level)\n- Perception: Detect and localize the target drawer handle (choose top or specified drawer). Estimate its pose and clearance.\n- Pre-grasp: Move to a pre-grasp pose ~8–12 cm in front of the handle at the correct height and orientation; ensure gripper opening exceeds handle thickness/width.\n- Approach: Execute a straight-line approach with low speed and compliance until contact/encirclement of the handle.\n- Grasp/engage: Close gripper (or hook) with gentle force; verify secure engagement via force/position check.\n- Pull: Retract along the drawer’s slide axis; monitor force to keep motion straight and stop if resistance spikes.\n- Recover: If grasp fails, back off, re-localize, and retry with a small lateral/height offset.\n\nIf you intended multiple keyframes, please share the remaining images so I can provide a full frame-by-frame state–action sequence and diagnose any emerging failure modes."
