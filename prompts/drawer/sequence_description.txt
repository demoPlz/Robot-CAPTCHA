1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.

3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.

4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.

5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.

6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.

7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.

8: We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.

11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.

13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.

14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.
