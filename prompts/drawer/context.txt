Round 1: Description bank

1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip the drawer handle.

3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open (translate-only to the left).

4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.

5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.

6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.

7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.

8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.

11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object are raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.

13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.

14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.

15. The drawer remains open; blue cube is in the drawer; yellow ball and red cube are still on the table. We will now pick the yellow ball, thus: move horizontally to bring the gripper to the general area above the yellow ball.

16. The gripper is in the general area above the ball but close to the drawer; to ensure collision-free access, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the yellow ball.

17. We are ~3cm above the ball, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the ball grasp angle.

18. Alignment complete but approach is tight against the drawer; to improve clearance, thus: retreat to home and re-approach from the front of the ball.

19. From home, the gripper is moved to the general area directly above the ball with good clearance, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the ball.

20. We are ~3cm above the ball, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to the grasp angle.

21. Rotation complete, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

22. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp the ball.

23. The gripper closes on the ball; grasp achieved, thus: raise (translation-only) to clear the drawer lip.

24. The ball is lifted clear, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened middle drawer.

25. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the ball into the drawer.

26. The ball drops but does not fully settle and may roll; to assess and continue, thus: return to the home position.

27. The drawer is open; ball appears to have rolled back out onto the table; red cube remains on the right near the drawer. To avoid picking near the drawer lip, we will first reposition the red cube left, thus: move to the general area above the red cube.

28. The gripper arrives above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3cm above the cube.

29. We are ~3cm above the cube, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align for a side grasp/push.

30. The gripper is oriented and lowered to contact; grasp would be collision-prone due to proximity to the drawer, so we switch to move object left protocol, thus: close lightly and engage the cube to prepare for a drag.

31. With contact established, dragging straight left would collide with the drawer; per move object left protocol step 6, thus: adjust the arm pose slightly forward to create a collision-free path.

32. Path is clear, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk to reposition the red cube further left.

33. The cube has been dragged left some distance, thus: continue dragging left until it is entirely left of the arm base area.

34. The cube is now clearly left of the base and away from the drawer, thus: release the cube and return to the home position.

35. With the cube safely left, we recover the earlier failure by repicking the yellow ball that is back on the table, thus: move to the general area above the yellow ball.

36. The gripper is above the ball, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the ball.

37. At ~3cm above, thus: rotate (rotate-only) to the grasp angle.

38. Alignment complete, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

39. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp the ball.

40. The ball is grasped, thus: raise (translation-only) to clear the drawer lip.

41. The ball is raised, thus: translate to be above the opened middle drawer.

42. The gripper is above the drawer, thus: open gripper to release the ball into the drawer (ensure release is centered to prevent rolling).

43. The ball settles inside the drawer; blue cube is already inside; red cube remains on the table left of the base. We will now pick and place the red cube, thus: return to home to begin the approach.

44. From home, move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the red cube.

45. We are above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the cube.

46. At ~3cm above the cube, thus: rotate (rotate-only) the gripper to align with the cube’s grasp angle.

47. Alignment complete, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

48. The gripper is at grasp height, thus: close gripper to grasp the red cube securely, ready to lift and place into the opened drawer in the next step.

50. The red cube is lifted clear, thus: move (translation-only) so the gripper is above the opened middle drawer.

51. The gripper is above the opened drawer holding the red cube, thus: open the gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

52. The red cube is now inside the open drawer with the ball and blue cube; to finish the task we must close the drawer, thus: reposition to be centered above the open drawer, ready to descend to pushing height.

53. We are centered above the open drawer, thus: move down and rotate the gripper to be on the same level as the drawer front to prepare to push it closed.

54. The gripper is aligned at drawer level and in contact path, thus: translate forward to make contact with the drawer front and begin the push.

55. Contact is established, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only).

56. The drawer is fully closed; to meet the success condition, thus: return to the home position.

57. No objects are on the table. The middle drawer is closed. The robot is in home position, thus: end.
