Round 1: Description bank

1. All three objects are on the desk; the drawer is closed. This is the very initial state of the task. Since at least one object: the blue cube, is completely left of the arm's base, we can open the drawer, and put the blue cube into the drawer. The immediate next subtask is to open the drawer, thus: position the arm to grip the handle of the middle drawer.

2. We are in position to grip the middle drawer's handle, thus: close the gripper to grip then drawer handle.

3. We have grasped onto the handle, thus: pull the drawer open.

4. We have pulled the drawer open. Next, we need to start putting objects into the drawer, thus: release the gripper.

5. We need to start getting into position to grasp the blue cube, the only object of the three distant enough from the drawer to safely grasp without collision, thus: return to the home position.

6. We need to move to the general area above the blue cube to prepare to grasp it, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube.

7. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is in the general area above the blue cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube.

8. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and pitched till vertical to be ~3cm above the blue cube, thus: rotate the gripper to align with grasp angle.

9. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is rotated to align with the grasp angle, thus: lower the gripper to prepare for grasp.

10. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is lowered and prepared for grasp, thus: close gripper to grasp.

11. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is closed and grasped onto the cube, thus: raise the gripper such that the gripper and the object clear the height of the edge of the drawer.

12. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper and object is raised so as to clear the height of the edge of the drawer, thus: move horizontally such that the gripper is above the opened drawer.

13. We follow the pick and place item into drawer protocol, and the gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release object into the drawer.

14. Next, we need to close the drawer, move the remaining object left, open the drawer, pick and place the objects into the drawer, and close the drawer again, thus: return to the home position.

15. Drawer is open; the blue cube is inside. Remaining objects: ball (center) and red cube (near the drawer). The ball can be picked directly; the red cube is too close to the drawer. Thus: move the gripper to the general area above the ball.

16. The gripper is above the ball area, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3 cm above the ball.

17. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate-only to align grasp angle.

18. The gripper is rotated, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

19. The gripper is lowered to the grasp point, thus: close gripper to grasp the ball.

20. The ball is grasped, thus: raise the gripper (translation-only) to clear the drawer edge height.

21. The ball is raised, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

22. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the ball into the drawer. If the ball lands partly on the lip, treat as a minor failure and recover.

23. The ball sits precariously on the drawer lip (failure). To recover while keeping space clear, thus: return to the home position.

24. We now need to reposition the red cube left so it is safe to pick later, thus: move the gripper to the general area above the red cube.

25. The gripper is above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3 cm above the cube.

26. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate-only to align with the cube’s grasp angle.

27. The gripper is rotated, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

28. The gripper is lowered to the grasp point, thus: close gripper to grasp the red cube.

29. The cube is grasped. To avoid collisions with the drawer/ball area, first adjust forward/back as needed, then execute the move-object-left protocol, thus: drag (translate-only) leftward along the desk.

30. The cube has been moved left and is now entirely left of the arm base, thus: open the gripper to release it.

31. The cube is released on the left side, clear of the drawer. We still need to ensure the ball is placed properly, thus: return to the home position.

32. We need to re-place the ball into the drawer, thus: move the gripper to the general area above the ball.

33. The gripper is above the ball, thus: lower and pitch till vertical to ~3 cm above the ball.

34. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate-only to align with grasp angle.

35. The gripper is rotated, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

36. The gripper is lowered, thus: close gripper to grasp the ball.

37. The ball is grasped, thus: raise the gripper (translation-only) to clear the drawer edge height.

38. The ball is raised, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

39. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the ball fully into the drawer.

40. The ball is placed inside the drawer. Next, we must pick and place the red cube now that it is safely left, thus: return to the home position.

41. We need to pick the red cube and put it into the drawer, thus: move the gripper to the general area above the red cube on the left.

42. The gripper is above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch till vertical to ~3 cm above the cube.

43. The gripper is lowered and pitched, thus: rotate-only to align with the cube’s grasp angle.

44. The gripper is rotated, thus: lower to prepare for grasp.

45. The gripper is lowered, thus: close gripper to grasp the red cube.

46. The red cube is grasped, thus: raise the gripper (translation-only) to clear the drawer edge height.

47. The gripper and cube are raised, thus: move (translation-only) to be above the opened drawer.

48. The gripper is above the opened drawer, thus: open gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

49. All items are in the opened drawer. We must now close the drawer, thus: move such that the gripper is above the front of the open drawer and can move down to the drawer’s level without collision.

50. The gripper is positioned above the drawer front, thus: move down and rotate the gripper flat to contact the drawer, preparing to push.

51. The gripper is in contact, thus: push the drawer closed (translate-only).

52. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position.

52. The drawer is closed and the task is complete, thus: return to the home position.

53. Drawer is open again in a new run; blue cube is inside, the ball rests on the drawer lip, and the red cube is on the desk left of center. The gripper is in the general area above the red cube, thus: lower and pitch the gripper till vertical to ~3 cm above the cube.

59. The gripper is over the open drawer, thus: open gripper to release the red cube into the drawer.

60. The red cube is placed in the drawer; the ball is still on the drawer lip. We must still secure the ball, thus: return to the home position.

61. From home we prepare to re-grasp the ball from the lip, thus: move (translation-only) toward the general area above the ball on the drawer lip.

62. The approach path is constrained by the drawer front and risks collision; visibility is poor, thus: adjust pose near the drawer front to search for a safe top-down approach.

63. The approach remains unsafe; we abort this attempt to avoid collision, thus: return to the home position to re-plan the ball re-grasp in subsequent steps.
