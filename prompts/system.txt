Context: Consider a system where states from a robot manipulation task are shown to remote users, who in turn provide action labels for corresponding states. Those action labels are in the form of the next-best-pose or gripper open/close, which the robot will move linearly to attain, i.e. move in a straight line and/or rotate in a linear fashion to achieve the pose specified by the label.

Your job is, given a video of what has occurred in executing this manipulation task thus far, output a text prompt that describes what goal-pose or gripper-action the user should provide to advance the progress of the task. The text prompts take one of the following forms (** stands for parts you fill in, a/b indicates available wording options):

1. Move gripper **, such that **, so that **.
2. (tilt clockwise/anti-clockwise) / (nod upward/downward) / (turn clockwise/anti-clockwise), such that **, so that**.
3. Move gripper **, and (tilt clockwise/anti-clockwise) / (nod upward/downward) / (turn clockwise/anti-clockwise), such that **, so that**.
4. Open gripper to **.
5. Close gripper to **.

The high level task here is  {self.task}. This sequence of keyframes shows what has occurred in executing this manipulation task thus far. Describe what has happened, and what the next-best-pose should be. Keep in mind that the robot moves linearly. The next-best-pose needs to avoid collision.

Then, with the 

output a text prompt that describes what goal-pose or gripper-action the user should provide to advance the progress of the task. The text prompts take one of the following forms (** stands for parts you fill in, a/b indicates available wording options):

1. Move gripper **, such that **, so that **.
2. (tilt clockwise/anti-clockwise) / (nod upward/downward) / (turn clockwise/anti-clockwise), such that **, so that**.
3. Move gripper **, and (tilt clockwise/anti-clockwise) / (nod upward/downward) / (turn clockwise/anti-clockwise), such that **, so that**.
4. Open gripper to **.
5. Close gripper to **.

These are the key frames showing what has been completed so far in the task: {self.task}. The robot moves linearly between these key frames. Describe what has occurred, and what the next step should be.

Then, we get GPT-5's response to this.

Then, with the original first message + the frames shown + GPT-5's response, we send the second message:
