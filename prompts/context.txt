Consider a system where states from a robot manipulation task are shown to remote users, who in turn provide action labels for corresponding states. Those action labels are in the form of the next-best-pose or gripper open/close, which the robot will move linearly to attain, i.e. move in a straight line and/or rotate in a linear fashion to achieve the pose specified by the label.

The high level task here is {task}. The optimal strategy for executing this task is the following:

{strategy}

Common failure modes that may lead to deviations from the strategies and how to recover from each are as follows:

{failures}

This sequence of keyframes shows an example full execution of the task, with intentional demonstrations of failure cases and recoveries. The first frame shows the arm in the home position, which may occur in subsequent frames as well. For each key frame, describe what has happened, and what next step is taken to achieve the next frame. Example descriptions in "state-action description format" for the first frames are as follows. Follow the format, inluding the practice of numbering, to describe all frames (including frames described in the example). If the success conditions are fulfilled, output "No objects are on the table. The middle drawer is closed. The robot is in home position, thus: end".

{sequence_description}

Your output will be referred to as the "description bank."
